# Hi, I’m Shiv 👋  
Senior GenAI / LLM Systems Engineer | 7+ Years Experience

I design and build **production-grade AI systems** with a strong focus on  
**LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agent architectures, and applied ML**.

My work spans from **model-level experimentation** to **end-to-end system design**,  
including inference pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and real-world integrations.

## 🔧 Core Expertise

- **Generative AI & LLMs**: RAG systems, prompt engineering, context design, evaluation
- **Agentic Systems**: Tool-using agents, multi-agent orchestration, MCP-based workflows
- **Machine Learning**: Classical ML, Deep Learning, NLP
- **Inference & Deployment**: Local LLMs (Ollama), API-based LLMs, performance trade-offs
- **Engineering**: Python, system design, experimentation-to-production pipelines

## 📌 What You’ll Find in This GitHub

This profile contains **hands-on, real-world implementations** rather than toy demos or tutorials.

Key areas include:

- **LLM Inference Systems**
  - Local LLM serving using Ollama
  - Quantization, latency, and cost-performance trade-offs

- **RAG Architectures**
  - Basic, hybrid, and reranked RAG pipelines
  - Chunking strategies, retrieval evaluation, and failure modes

- **Agent Frameworks**
  - Tool-using agents
  - Multi-agent coordination patterns
  - MCP-based integrations (SQL, APIs)

- **Real-world Work**
  - Select client-style case studies
  - Practical GenAI use cases beyond notebooks

## 🧠 Philosophy

I focus on **how systems fail**, not just how they work.

That means:
- Designing for ambiguity
- Measuring quality beyond “it looks good”
- Treating LLMs as **probabilistic components**, not magic APIs
